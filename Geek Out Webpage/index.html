            <p style="width: 500px;">Geek-Out is a transformation of the card-based party game, Geek Out!, an application
                that can be played virtually. Players are able to join virtual game rooms via a room code and play width
            friends no matter where they are!  </p>
            <p style="width: 500px;"> Geek-Out implements a simple user interface that allows players to play their favorite card game 
                without feeling confused or indifferent as the application is extremely easy to use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b> Here are the rules for the game:</b> <br>
            <p style="width: 500px;">Players take turns selecting questions. A die is rolled to select a category. 
              If the die comes up blank, then the player can choose the category. A question is then selected from 
              the given category. Players then bid on who can come up with the most answers for a given question. 
              (Questions are phrased in a way to allow this bidding, like <q>How many Ironman villains can you name?</q>)
               Once all but one player has passed on bidding, the player who won the bid gets 60 seconds to provide 
               as many answers as they can think of. The other players are then given an opportunity to contest 
               the answers provided. If all of the valid answers left are more than the bid, then the players wins 
               their bid in points. The next player then takes their turn selecting a question. This cycle continues 
               until any player earns more than 10 points. That player is the winner of the game.</p>
